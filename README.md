**repliclust** (pronounced *rep*-*lee*-*clust*, from *repli*cate and *clust*er)
is a Python package for generating synthetic data sets with clusters. 

The package is based on *data set archetypes*, high-level geometric
descriptions of whole classes of data sets. Our framework allows you to
generate similar but distinct data sets, making benchmarks more
informative and reproducible; **repliclust** builds upon SciPy and NumPy
and is meant to complement scikit-learn.
