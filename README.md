**repliclust** is a Python package for generating synthetic data sets 
with clusters. 

The package is based on data set *archetypes*, high-level geometric 
blueprints that allow you to sample many data sets with the same overall
geometric structure; **repliclust** builds upon SciPy and NumPy and is
meant to complement scikit-learn.
