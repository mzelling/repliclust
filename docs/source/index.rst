Synthetic Data for Cluster Analysis
===================================

**repliclust** is a Python package for generating synthetic datasets with clusters. It allows you to generate many different datasets that are geometrically similar, but *without* ever touching low-level parameters like cluster centroids or covariance matrices.

Features
--------

- Reproducibly generate clusters with defined geometric characteristics
- Manage cluster overlaps, shapes, and probability distributions through intuitive, high-level controls
- Define custom dataset archetypes to power reproducible and informative benchmarks
