Synthetic Data for Cluster Analysis
===================================

**repliclust** (pronounced *rep*-*lee*-*clust*, from *repli*\ cate and *clust*\ er) is
a Python package for generating synthetic data sets with clusters.
It is based on *data set archetypes*, high-level geometric descriptions
of whole classes of data sets. Our framework allows you to generate
similar but distinct data sets, making benchmarks more informative and
reproducible.
