    """
    A data set archetype that defines the overall geometry of a data
    set using max-min ratios.
    
    The user sets the ratios between largest and smallest values 
    of various geometric parameters.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int
        The desired number of clusters.
    dim : int
        The desired number of dimensions.
    radius_maxmin : float, >=1
        Ratio between the maximum and minimum radii among all clusters
        in a mixture model.
    aspect_maxmin : float, >=1
        Ratio between the maximum and minimum aspect ratios among all 
        clusters in a mixture model.
    aspect_ref : float, >=1
        Typical aspect ratio for the clusters in a mixture model.
        For example, if aspect_ref = 10, we expect that all clusters
        in the mixture model are strongly elongated.
    imbalance_maxmin : float, >=1
        Ratio between the greatest and smallest group sizes among all
        clusters in the mixture model.
    min_overlap : float in (0,1)
        The minimum required overlap between a cluster and ANY other
        cluster. This minimum overlap allows you to guarantee that no
        cluster will be isolated from all other clusters.
    max_overlap : float in (0,1)
        The maximum allowed level of overlap between any two clusters. 
        Measured as the fraction of cluster volume that overlaps.
    scale : float
        Reference length scale for generated data
    distributions : list of [str | tuple[str, dict]]
        Selection of probability distributions that should appear in
        each mixture model. Format is a list in which each element is 
        either the name of the probability distribution OR a tuple whose
        first entry is the name and the second entry is a dictionary of 
        distributional parameters. To print the names of all supported
        distributions and their parameters (along with default values), 
        print the output of repliclust.get_supported_distributions().

    
    Notes
    -----

    Below is a short glossary of some geometric terms used above.

    Group size : int
        The number of data points in a cluster.
    Cluster radius : float
        Geometric mean of the standard deviations along a cluster's 
        principal axes (eigenvectors of covariance matrix).
    Cluster aspect ratio : float
        Ratio between the lengths of a cluster's longest and shortest
        principal axes (eigenvectors of covariance matrix). 
        This value equals 1 for a spherical cluster and exceeds 1 for 
        an oblong cluster.
